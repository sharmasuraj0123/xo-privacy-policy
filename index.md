# Privacy Policy for XO’s Custom GPT MVP Ideation Tool
**Effective Date:** June 28, 2025

At XO, we respect your privacy and believe in being completely transparent about how your data is handled when using our custom GPT tool designed to help you ideate, refine, and generate MVP Scope of Work (SoW) documents.

## What Data We Collect
When you interact with our GPT tool, we collect:

- **Conversation Data**: Everything you type and everything generated by the GPT during your session.
- **Unique Session Identifier**: An internal ID linked to your chat session.
- **Email Address**: Collected at the end of the session solely to send the generated SoW document.
- **Name**: Collected at the end of the session and used only to personalize email communication when sending the SoW.

We do not collect any other personally identifiable information unless you choose to enter it during your conversation. You are not required to sign in to use the tool.

## How We Use Your Data
We use the data you provide to:

- Generate a tailored Scope of Work (SoW) document for your MVP.
- Personalize the email in which we send your generated SoW by addressing you by name.
- Improve our internal tools, systems, and models by training AI systems on anonymized conversation data.
- Conduct research and product development at XO to enhance our services.

## AI Model Training
Your conversations may be used to train and improve AI models. This helps us deliver better ideation, automation, and product planning support in future interactions.

We do not use your data for commercial resale or advertising.

## Third-Party Access
We use OpenAI’s API to power our GPT-based interactions. While your prompts are processed by OpenAI, they are not stored long-term by OpenAI, per their API use policy.

No other third parties have access to your data. Only authorized personnel at XO can access the stored information.

## Data Security
We take security seriously. All conversation data is stored securely, and access is strictly limited to XO’s internal systems. Measures include:

- Access control and audit logging
- Secure cloud storage
- No public exposure of data

## Data Deletion & Retention
At this time, users cannot request deletion of their conversation data. We retain the data indefinitely to support SoW generation and internal model training.

## Email and Name Use
We only use your **email address** to send you the Scope of Work.  
We only use your **name** to personalize the email in which the SoW is sent.  
Neither is used for marketing or shared with third parties.

## Legal Compliance
XO is based in the United States, and our data practices are governed under U.S. privacy laws. As of now, we do not support GDPR, CCPA, or other regional data deletion or portability requests.
