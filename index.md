# Privacy Policy for XO’s Custom GPT
**Effective Date:** August 14, 2025  

At **XO**, we respect your privacy and are transparent about how your data is handled when using our custom GPT tool designed to help you ideate, refine, and share your product context for future use.

## What Data We Collect  

When you interact with our GPT tool, we collect:  

- **Conversation Data** – Everything you type and everything generated by the GPT during your session.  
- **Unique Session Identifier** – An internal ID linked to your chat session.  
- **Project ID** – Provided by you when you choose to “Share to XO.”  
- **Optional Identifiers** – Only if you choose to include them in your conversation (e.g., your name).  

You are **not** required to sign in to use the tool. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you choose to share it.

## How We Use Your Data  

We use the data you provide to:  

1. Save your project context to XO’s knowledgebase so it can be accessed later by other AI tools or services.  
2. Maintain continuity so you don’t need to repeat the same context to different AI systems.  
3. Improve XO’s internal tools and systems by training AI systems on anonymized conversation data.  
4. Conduct research and product development to enhance XO’s services.

## AI Model Training  

Your conversations **may** be used to train and improve AI models. This helps us provide better ideation, automation, and context continuity in future interactions.  

We **do not** use your data for commercial resale or advertising.  

---

## Third-Party Access  

- We use **OpenAI’s API** to power our GPT-based interactions. While your prompts are processed by OpenAI, they are not stored long-term by OpenAI, per their API use policy.  
- No other third parties have access to your data. Only authorized XO personnel can access stored information.  

---

## Data Security  

We take security seriously. All conversation data is stored securely, and access is strictly limited to XO’s internal systems. Measures include:  

- Access control and audit logging  
- Secure cloud storage  
- No public exposure of stored data  

---

## Data Deletion & Retention  

At this time, users cannot request deletion of their conversation data. We retain the data indefinitely to support context sharing, AI improvements, and service continuity.  

---

## Legal Compliance  

XO is based in the United States, and our data practices are governed under U.S. privacy laws.  
We currently do not support GDPR, CCPA, or other regional data deletion or portability requests.
